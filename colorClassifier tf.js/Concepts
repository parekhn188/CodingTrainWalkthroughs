Inputs are RGB, output wanted is a label

=> making a 1D vector from a particular index (all 0s and that index is 1)


SoftMax/Categorical Cross-Entropy (Activation/Loss)

SM
=> similar to sigmoid normalization
=> e ^ particular input value / summation of those squared values
=> Ensures total adds to 100%

CE
=> Output desired is a probablilty distribution
=> Entropy between 2 probablilty distributions
=> - Summation of the product of one prob distribution with the log of the other probablilty distribution
