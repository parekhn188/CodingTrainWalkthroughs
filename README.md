# coding_train_tutorials

Hi GitHub! 

My name is Nisarg and I am a relatively new programmer. I spent my entire summer doing a bunch of follow along projects with Daniel Shiffman from the YouTube channel The Coding Train and this repository consists of the multitude of topics I covered with him. My primary focus was learning JS and NodeJS, that is why there are particularly large amount of JS files in the repo, but my summer initially began with CV projects using Processing and Java.

Of couse I could not pass up the opportunity to learn AI and Machine Learning, so there are a few projects dedicated to those subjects, many of which contain a customized Neural-Network library that I created as a part of the NN series on the channel, as well as the reknown TF.Js framework. Moreover, there are multiple web app visualizations of ML algorithms and search algorithms also in the repo. 

I will hopefuly be uploading more projects as I continue to learn and will also be posting my own projects that I have been working on with all the knowledge I've gained over the summer.
